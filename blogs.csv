1802605,How To Measure Environmental Sustainability In Software Development,Ladies and Gentlemen — I present to you the calculated amount of time we have until the world’s...,lady gentleman present calculated amount time world average temperature go 1.5 celsius 2.7 fahrenheit .. countdown timer titled climate clock say year day hour minute 1.5 difference doesnt sound like much small number actually mean huge change globally .. thats word average important .. basically give u thing worry .. thing like higher sea level .. frequent natural disaster .. flood hurricane wildfire .. course cant forget pesky extreme heat wave would happen world-wide .. basically spinning globe fire oh wouldnt end also side effect wed consider .. economy industry would change .. agriculture impossible certain area .. different kind plant wildlife would disappear coral reef especially .. lot thing change sooner rather later .. thats environmental sustainability become important topic last decade project like climate clock become key raising awareness incentivizing action go green .. awareness help create small action small action snowball big change .. mean u software development field lot actually .. sitting era exponential technological advancement like nobody ever seen .. woman prosthetic try first time surprised let take prosthetic arm industry benchmark one company successfully made cost-effective superior alternative .. level progress year could even begin imagine thing look like next well guess forefront change .. one decide create healthier better status quo .. thats important everybody devs designer manager first understand exact trajectory going current tech causing globally .. cause dont pfff right let start obviously-not-so-obvious .. software affect planet software doesnt anything doesnt exist .. collection symbol character somebody somewhere put together represent logic design .. never run nothing happens doesnt emit anything .. green .. yet know better .. doesnt exist vacuum life alongside hardware run .. closeup circuit board software give hardware instruction resource use long use circuitry really small component heat letting u process download upload data need .. unfortunately running hardware isnt free action use energy electricity source execution .. software make hardware run hardware us electricity electricity production emits greenhouse gas .. wait producing electricity emits greenhouse gas meme seymour simpson saying yes electricity production emits greenhouse gas every country electrical sector degree need burn fossil fuel production meet demand .. even incredible advancement weve made greener method like harnessing solar wind still havent reached level zero emission production possible .. give idea bad electricity production accounted total emission u alone becoming second largest source right behind transportation sector expecting number grow coming year .. starting see software play part .. havent talked exactly software force hardware use less energy given time .. software cause u use electricity context software production sector there main area say electricity needed production software use software user think production everything involved project cycle hardware run power online meeting design program development planning testing internet connection fixing error monitor battery charge office light spotify everybodys air conditioning cell phone use everything would associate electronic resource used project .. second case mentioned talking much electricity needed run software user everything related happens development done maintained using simple example website right decided click link led browser connected web server hold code information website .. hopefully second browser downloaded file webserver .. browser run code usually know html cs javascript reproduce structure design logic team developer wanted see read article .. consumes energy along way .. billy may meme saying wait there there actually two scenario .. case wed still need consider infrastructure server service need run alongside software hardware run dont see .. think datacenters database cloud computing crms technology needed run maintain handling data production use user .. data center example use electricity running cooling hardware matter indirect still take account want know variable .. put software strange place doesnt software invisible waste product .. always obvious happens every time turn computer day every time need build deploy code .. lot thing happen background directly dont see .. way reduce waste however small systematically set forget make small change catalyst bigger change let find .. measure sustainability software measuring green given piece software always pretty tricky reason 1. software rarely run computer usually hundred small program process service running device time unless tested specific condition knowing energy consumed one collection process rarely straight forward .. 2. mentioned sometimes software us service outside going back data center example project choice data center chooses burn fossil fuel v one opts use greener energy change total number even usually dont know much energy used data center dedicated software mention lot time data center dont report electricity used finding choosing number isnt easy .. 3. depending thing like hardware o youre running program run different machine use different amount resource heck even kind machine case different electrical use .. take modern operating system example week installed machine o learns optimize resource allocation better reason new machine thats running week end consuming less energy one thats installed yesterday .. oh also cant forget virtual machine also thing piece software simulate piece software would energy used simulated machine one run non-simulated machine would resource allocation usage probably would almost impossible u get practical measurement sustainability software best estimate .. even isnt always easy .. best attempt ive found trying create estimation study think worth read .. case website tool like website carbon give u good number much co2 used every page open .. case outside measuring device general electricity use estimating external service software us well never one magic number .. although indirect number measure instead .. improve sustainability code project world sustainability something called r .. refuse reduce reuse re-purpose repair rot recycle idea behind try follow principle well road sustainable future .. maybe instead measuring thing like amount waste electricity used work reducing alternative could measure progress implementing principle work measuring progress improving upon way .. perfect since r associated physical product life cycle might applicable work .. hey let see one starting refuse say decision could create waste .. originally principle related reducing buying decision action could create extra waste thing like buying much food risking going bad avoiding product arent sustainable one create lot waste .. software project refusing could mean saying negotiating client request project go sustainability value .. refusing negotiating client new software requirement sustainable alternative .. refuse going non-green data center service software opt using sustainable one .. refuse integrating full library package solution know youll use small portion code prefer using custom code smaller lighter library .. drawback might lead project might end expensive time consuming client development .. know though maybe able position proposal sustainability focused project follows strict green value could make extra expense time worth certain company market growing future .. side note principle seems land high level issue one depend company policy sustainability approach selling .. probably take little creativity execute effectively .. onwards reduce minimize waste lot creates waste original principle relates action reduce waste might produce instead right reducing looking way minimize damage example include utilizing reusable bag grocery choosing product create less waste would go category .. software project reducing could mean opting go upsell sustainable greener project wasteful one .. implementing system guideline involved project reduce electricity use something simple lowering screen brightness big long run .. use good design principle minimize user time spent software trying find something x amount co2 produced every page click would happen average user clicked one less page per session create solution reduce use resource developer user device includes thing like optimizing reducing file size compressing minifying refactoring code .. one tool could incredibly helpful estimating resource use big notation .. concept used computer science estimate fast algorithm grows time idea complicated memory cpu resource consume let say manage lower number less resource used time less electricity used per execution sustainable .. reuse repurposing extend life product .. product dont always single use time reutilized new way even give somebody use .. even better little creativity used way werent intended old clothes cut used rag paint bucket turned pot plant .. software project reusing repurposing could mean reutilizing already optimized code template email proposal design project reduce development time newer similar project maybe even share co-worker .. contributing open source project library know stack overflow help also developer project problem .. repurposing existing design new project swipe file design past project huge time saver designer .. idea behind created something chance extend life saving helping future self future team somebody else process extra important side note here article erik dietrich code reuse philosophy come code good perspective put effort avoiding duplication necessarily focusing reusing code quite distinction .. last three r seems like dont apply since software doesnt cause physical waste unless talking hardware thats talk another day there need repair rot recycle software .. hopefully article helped clear air around invisible impact software life action matter little start towards greener future .. tip iceberg im afraid .. there still lot talk topic could implemented professionally day day unfortunately kind change happen purposeful action .. would involve systematic implementation part company culture .. hardest part would probably come choosing measure action measuring behavior change needed implement system .. even success probably depend putting good focus easy high impact action .. sustainability always hard metric prioritize especially thing like profit growth take precedence long term .. job find opportunity able make happen .. change status quo .. helpful resource used research article run entertaining front-end newsletter web exceptional frontend devs want front-end centered newsletter try different everybody else big focus put making unique importantly fun also time helping devs become exceptional .. sign ..,"sustainability, softwaredevelopment, learning,

1256586,Filters in Rails with Query Object Pattern,What will you learn?    Use the Query Object Pattern to implement a sustainable filter logic...,learn use query object pattern implement sustainable filter logic model controller connect filter logic view building reusable filter component .. introduction filtering process refining data set excluding data according certain criterion filter frequently used search information large datasets efficiently effectively .. filter component accessibility tool increase accessibility visibility data providing set predefined option select information designwise consists form multiple input field corresponding filter condition filter used combination list table filter form submitted associated list table updated displaying result match submitted filter form condition value .. filter component amazon.com search tv important complement list table filter make easier user navigate implementing filter application recurring issue filter vary depending multiple aspect data model work list table attached filter user need etc .. thus important implement filter logic easy reuse multiple context different set condition .. basic filter data implementation perspective filtering consists performing multiple custom query fetch data different filter condition .. rail model class count query interface consisting set class method fetch record database work abstraction layer build raw sql query easily use interface method implement custom query .. query interface method return relation relation also access query interface method allows chaining multiple query method invocation assemble complex sql query easily create filter query include custom query need chain custom query query always filter document title author however filter condition usually optional filter value missing respective condition considered filtering result example pas title document filter filter result author .. could update custom query method wrapping statement filter value present relation returned however returning nil value instead relation break chain custom query .. solution problem using class method also part query interface method defines new model class method retrieving querying data custom query previously defined however scope query lenient value always returning relation use scope make custom query conditional preserving chain ability .. even though come nice way define custom query implement filter query current approach present multiple design flaw need addressed model main responsibility exchanging data database implementing part business logic filter hand answer accessibility problem thus related model responsibility model responsible handling filter logic .. filtering model-agnostic logic model filter result similarly placing method model implies model must define filter logic redundant .. definition custom query scope model class lead big model class overloaded filter query .. query object pattern query object pattern design pattern consists defining specialized object encapsulate information required perform specific data query logic case filter query query sort query example .. use pattern solution refactoring filter logic specialized object responsible assembling filter sql query .. implementation query object pattern delegating filter logic query object solves problem previously mentioned model need know filter record query object reduces model responsibility remove filter-related code .. query object share common filter logic making system less redundant .. next line explain implement query object pattern simple scenario .. problem application write organized zero many belong want allow user filter different criterion .. solution model already learned define optional filter query since filter custom query optional must add conditional clause avoid redundancy define scope method instead chain custom query filter query value present .. approach allows u define common filter logic custom query share across filtrable model .. let start implementing query object moving model method work context respective model class extract use extend default model class scope filter scope via extending method method requires known scope class model

filterable model scope example allow u assemble filter query query create complex query easily controller controller handle http request return proper output response controller responsible defining interface filter record consists defining filter parameter filterable controller set filter parameter logic define use fetch result thus encapsulate concern better reusability concern defines method requires method set filter formatted key-value pair represent name filter scope value filter respectively .. usually controller work unique set however always case flexibility using multiple filter parameter method admits optional parameter .. last defined helper method idea make request filter parameter accessible filterable controller view thanks filter component fetch parameter update form field according define filter parameter method make sure also declare helper .. include concern controller update action filter .. view mentioned beginning post filter component form input field represents filter condition implementing simple form straightforward task thanks rail helper method two implementation issue addressed .. first loading form field filled user request filter parameter

solve problem could simply give instruction people working project run completely resolve problem people might already different version request installed machine would raise error could raise different error related incompatibility different version used say `` work machine '' need way share exactly version using current project people make work properly fortunately python come solution
